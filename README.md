🏠 DormFix – Fixing Hostel Life, One Issue at a Time

A smart hostel management system where students report issues instantly, admins resolve them efficiently, and every action is tracked transparently.

🎮 Demo (Prototype): 📊 Admin Panel Preview:

⚠️ Note: DormFix is optimized for web & mobile-first usage to ensure quick issue reporting even on low bandwidth.

🌟 Features

✅ One-click student issue reporting (water, electricity, cleanliness, safety, Wi-Fi, etc.)

✅ Real-time admin dashboard for issue tracking & resolution

✅ Priority-based complaint handling (urgent / normal / low)

✅ Status updates: Reported → In Progress → Resolved

✅ Notification system for students & wardens

✅ Issue history & analytics for better hostel management

🛠 How It Works

Student selects an issue category and submits a complaint with optional photo/video. DormFix assigns the issue to the relevant admin/maintenance staff. Admin updates progress and resolution status in real time. Student receives notifications until the issue is resolved. All issues are logged for accountability and analysis.
